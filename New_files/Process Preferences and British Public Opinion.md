**Synopsis:**

Survey conducted by YouGov with 1382 participants, data weighted for representativeness of UK population. Asks people to place themselves on a 7-point scale where would people place themselves and governments recent policies. And where they would place themselves and current government in terms of level of public involvement in decision-making. 

Individuals placed themselves in middle for both, and placed government on the right. 

Demographic features: more educated more left-wing policy, as are younger and female. Greater policy dissatisfaction from those with affiliation other than conservatives. For process space, more educated and politically interested were less supportive of direct democracy, but does not influence gap size. Older people more stealth democratic and lower gap. Conservative correlated with greater stealth democracy. Affiliation with other than three major = increase direct democracy and dissatisfaction. 

Politicians standards, politicians care, national economy, and policy gap are all significant, with national economy the only one with a 95% CI, as compared to 99.9% CI.

Also looks at how the various included measures influence agreement to statements on following laws that you do not personally agree with, weak effects for politicians standards and care for this.

**1) What is the central argument that the authors want to make?**

Analyses importance of process space and policy space in the UK context, both for governmental approval and support for a number of questions regarding civic norms

People generally support both involvement of people and government, though those more critical of government show greater support for public involvement

Other factors more important than process evaluations

**2) What is the method that the authors use to make that argument?**

Uses a survey from March 2011, conducted by YouGov. 1,382 respondents, with data weighted for representativeness of UK population

Conducted during a period where economic outcomes were less favourable, austerity measures were starting to have an impact -pg.391

Use same 7 point scale as in Hibbing and Theiss-Morse’s study, with 1 being the extreme liberal or power-to-the people position, and 7 being the opposite end of the spectrum

Translates to the Uk context by switching to a left-right divide, focusing on the level of state involvement within the economy

No change to process space measures in Uk context, though there is a stronger history of representative democracy in the UK -pg.395

Questions used:

“In politics, people sometimes talk about parties and politicians as being on the left or right. Using the 1–7 scale, where the end marked 1 means left and the end marked 7 means right, where would you place ... [yourself?] [the government’s recent policies?]” -pg.395

“Some people say that what we need in this country is for ordinary people to make political decisions for themselves about what needs to be done and how. Others say ordinary people are too busy and should instead allow elected politicians and officials to make all political decisions. Still others say a combination would be best. Imagine a seven-point scale with 1 being ordinary people making all decisions on their own and 7 being elected politicians and fficials making all the decisions on their own, while 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 indicate in-between opinions on the two extremes. Which number from 1 to 7 best represents ... [how you think the system of governing Britain should work?] [how you think the system of governing Britain actually does work?]” -pg.395

**3) What results do the authors obtain from their method?**

Most people placed themselves in the middle of the policy spectrum (mean of 4.0) while placing recent government policies at a mean of 5.3 -pg.396

In process space most located themselves in middle, with mean of 4.1. Perceived process was highly skewed to the right, with a mean of 6.1

Mean of policy and process gap (difference between individuals position and perceived position) were 2.2 for both

More educated more likely to be on the left-side of the political spectrum. Party identification clearly an important indicator of policy preferences. Older and male respondents more likely to be right-wing, though age is a weaker predictor -pg.399

Older people and those more interested in politics have higher policy gap, especially important for political interest. Party identification strong predictor, with no affiliation or affiliation with any other party than conservatives leading to greater policy dissatisfaction -pg.400

Education and interest in politics have positive correlation with process preferences (with the more interested and educated being less supportive of direct democracy), interest in politics is a much stronger predictor. Though they have insignificant effect on process gap. Broadhseet readers don’t show statistical difference in policy preferences but are more likely to be satisfied with the current process -pg.400

Age is predictor for both variables, with older people being more stealth democrat and less dissatisfied (weak correlations but no standard error) -pg.400

Partisanship is less significant predictor than it was in policy space, though being conservative is still a significant predictor of stealth democracy support and less dissatisfaction with system. Another strong predictor is being a partisan of a party other than the three majors, who are more left-wing and less satisfied (this is the strongest predictor of all factors though it also has a large standard error and so may not be). Other parties don’t show significant relationship, though the two that are significant are on par with other factors such as broadsheet readership or political interest -pg.400

Second model includes measures of political disaffection, include measure of politician reputation and state of economy. (asks how they rate honesty and integrity of politicians on 5-point scale, whether politicians care what people like them think). In this second model interest in politics, age and other party identification are still significant on process preferences, now liberal democrat support, politician’s standards and politicians care are also significant factors. -pg.401

Looking at process gap in model B; broadsheet readership still significant, age and partisanship are no longer important factors (other party still shows high correlation but high standard error means can’t be confident as to result). Politicians standards, politicians care, national economy, and policy gap are all significant, with national economy the only one with a 95% CI, as compared to 99.9% CI. -table on pg.400

Increased dissatisfaction with politicians or policy also sees increased dissatisfaction with the process. As economy is better the support of the process also increases -pg.402

“Political engagement and partisan variables are only able to account for 3 per cent of the variance in the process gap measure. The inclusion of measures of politicians’ reputations, economic evaluations and satisfaction with policy outputs enables us to account for 16 per cent” -pg.402

Tests the relationship between multiple variables and the response to the question do you approve or disapprove of the governments record to date, could only respond no or yes. Strongest predictors are labour and conservative partisanship. Policy gap is significant but process gap is not once we account for the following factors. When including factors such as politicians care, standards, and the state of economy, these all show to be correlated to a high CI -pg.403

On question of compliance with laws that the individual does not agree with: age is significant even when including the contemporary factors discussed above (older more compliant), strongest predictor in both is conservative partisanship, labour partisanship is only significant when not including contemporary factors, only other significant relationship is a weak relationship with process satisfaction when not accounting for contemporary factors. For contemporary factors, national economy does not matter, only politicians standards and care are significant relationships (~0.17 with SE=0.08) -pg.404

With regards to duty to vote question: Partisanship with any of the three major parties is significant even when controlling for contemporary factors (labour and lib dems strongest at >0.8, SE</=0.24 at weakest), Interest in politics strong predictor with high CI (0.49 with SE=0.01 when accounting for contemporary factors), age is also positive predictor (older = more duty to vote, high CI but low correlation). Of the contemporary factors, politicians standards and the economic state are the important factors (better politicians = increased duty, worse economy = increased duty) -pg.404

Policy gap and process gap are both unimportant to likelihood to vote -pg.404



**4) What conclusions do the authors draw from their results?**

Route of causality between process dissatisfaction and politician and policy satisfaction is unclear

Important to include the contextual factors of politicians care, standards, and the state of the economy as they reflect the politics of the time and so therefore can be accounted for when making broad statements -pg.404

Greater policy gap present in these finding than in the American study.

Process gap was a less significant predictor of attitudes around voting than in the American study, though its significance was washed out when including factors such as attitudes around politicians (still suggests a sort of process importance in the UK)

Many potential explanations of the difference between the UK and US. Slightly different question wording, different political cultures and experience with ordinary people making decisions, or could be the context that the UK study was conducted during a recession and where policy gap was more significant, which subsequently reduced importance of process in peoples minds 

**5) What counter-arguments, limitations, or alternative perspectives can shed light on the argument, method, results, or conclusions?**

Process space focus is simplistic and may miss some other aspects of process with potential disagreements (highlighted in paper), regardless it focuses on the main area of tension. Introducing complexity also makes it less likely that citizens will have strong positions on the issues

Question whether individuals will have a solid conceptual understanding of the left-right dimension familiar to the more politically knowledgeable (mentioned in text) -pg.396

Similar problem to Hibbing’s study in that it does not specify the form of direct democracy, leaves to peoples imagination the form used and does not necessarily encapsulate the idea of informed citizens taking part in decision-making

**Reflections:**

Hibbing and Theiss-morse’s study was conducted during a good economic period

**Useful readings:**

(Ezrow and Xezonakis, 2011) talk about the important of policy offerings on citizen’s satisfaction with democracy

((Clarke et al., 2004; 2009) Governments that perform well in delivering universally desirable outcomes like economic prosperity tend to do well in the next elections 

“Indeed, recent research suggests that economic performance can affect levels of public support for liberal democracy in established and transitional democracies (Kotzian, 2011)” -pg.393

“Meanwhile, a body of cross-national research has explored the extent of support for referenda and other institutions of direct democracy (Bowler et al., 2007; Dalton et al., 2001; Donovan and Karp, 2006)” -pg.393

“Christopher Carman (2010) found that petitioners’ evaluations of the Scottish Parliament’s petitioning process affected trust in devolved Scottish political institutions” -pg.393

“Meanwhile, citizens’ perceptions of procedural justice can influence their willingness to comply with governmental institutions and laws (Tyler, 1990; Tyler and Blader, 2003)” -pg.393
