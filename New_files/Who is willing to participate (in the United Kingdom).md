**Synopsis:**

Survey measure intended to capture attitudes of UK public regarding decision-making mechanisms. Uses agreement to statements from work of Hibbing and Neblo, in order to capture attitudes of Stealth Democracy and Sunshine Democracy. Obvious weakness is that these are only statements rather than particular forms of government.

Average scores for both forms was quite high, higher for Sunshine Democracy. Negative correlation suggests that these capture two different groups, although there are a number of people who score highly on both statements. Stealth democrats tend to be lower on political interest, lower educational attainment, lack political efficacy, are younger, female, of lower social grade, and hold more right-wing views

Stealth democratic attitudes correlated with lower support for different forms of participating in politics, but greater support for referendums. Sunshine democratic leads to greater support for all forms of participation. Higher education boosts participation support, except for referendums where it has a negative effect. 

Interesting that there was evidence of discomfort around political argument, and that people took disagreement personally. Serves as a potential caution to deliberation. 

**1) What is the central argument that the authors want to make?**

Research from Neblo (2001) shows that American citizens actually showed wider willingness to deliberate than expected, and that it came from those least likely to participate in current politics -pg.750

Study conducted in Finland found those groups less involved in traditional politics showed increased support for direct democracy -pg.750

**2) What is the method that the authors use to make that argument?**

Uses internet survey conducted in summer 2011, representative quota sample on key demographic factors and turnout

Calculate orientations towards stealth democracy or greater participation through number of questions. Asked to respond to strength of agreement with statements from Hibbings work: 

“Politicians would help the country more if they would stop talking and just take action on important problems



What people call ‘compromise’ in politics is really just selling out one’s principles



Government would run better if decisions were left up to non-elected independent experts



Government would run better if decisions were left up to successful business people” -pg.752







Measures to calculate dissatisfied democracy come from Neblo’s work and are called sunshine democracy measures:

“Openness to other peoples views and willingness to compromise are important in a country as diverse as ours



It is important for elected officials to discuss and debate things thoroughly before making major policy changes



In a democracy like ours, there are some important differences between how government should be run and how a business should be managed



It is important for the people and their elected representatives to have the final say in running government, rather than leaving it up to unelected experts” -pg.756





Check how these individuals support different form of participatory democracy: looks at deliberative democracy, referendums, party-electoral, and non-party participation -pg.760

Checks willingness to get involved at party electoral through variety of questions on pg.761 (includes whether you would be willing to vote, become political candidate, campaign, donate to a party, become a member of a party, hold office in a political organisation or pressure group, or contact a local councillor)

**3) What results do the authors obtain from their method?**

Overall 36.8% of respondents agreed or tended to agree to these statements, highest support was as 60.4% for first statement, and lowest was for the experts at 19.5%

Respondents don’t seem too concerned with conflict avoidance

Around 1/5 of respondents admitted political argument makes them uncomfortable and that they don’t want to justify their beliefs to those that disagree with them -pg.754

Large number also responded that they took it personally when someone disagrees with their political views, only 7.6% provided an answer in the opposing direction -pg.755

Multiples measures result in stealth-democratic orientation measures scaled between 10 and 50, mean is 27.4 and this measure has slightly higher alpha score of 0.618

Overwhelming support for the sunshine democracy statements, 70.4% agreement. Particularly strong support for statement around thorough debate of major policy changes (79.6% in favour) -pg.756

Score for sunshine runs from 4 to 20; sample mean of 15.7 and alpha reliability score of 0.762

Bivariate correlation of -.301 between the two measures, shows that they capture different people with different positions -pg.758

Not a perfect measure as 25.3% score highly on both measures of stealth democracy and dissatisfied democracy -pg.758

More individuals can be placed in the high dissatisfied democratic option -pg.758

Where the independent variables are significant, they act on the measures of dissatisfied democracy and stealth democracy in different ways -pg.759

Stealth democrats tend to be lower on political interest, lower educational attainment, lack political efficacy, are younger, female, of lower social grade, and hold more right-wing views -pg.759

Measure for party electoral activity runs from 7 to 14 and recruits mean of 8.7, alpha is 0.747 -pg.761

Willingness to participate in non-party forms uses similar questions on pg.762 and has scale from 7 to 14; mean is 9.1 and alpha of 0.756 -pg.762

Deliberative democracy measures asks people two questions; to rate on scale of 1-4 willingness to participate in a day-long or hour long session where citizens discuss important issues with local MP’s or councillors. Mean was 2.75 -pg.762

Support for referendums gathered by response to statement; referendums are a good way to decide important political questions. Asked to respond on scale of 1-5 and mean was 3.67

The higher the stealth orientation the lower support for party electoral or non-paety forms of participation, as well as with deliberation. Support is higher amongst stealth democrats for referendums -pg.763

Higher the individuals dissatisfied democrat orientation the greater the support for the different forms of participation, including referendums 

Education, political efficacy and political interest and positively correlate with different forms of participation. except for education and referendums where the relationship inverses -pg.764

Social grade shares positive relationship with willingness to get involved in deliberative and party electoral forms of participation -pg.764#



**4) What conclusions do the authors draw from their results?**



**5) What counter-arguments, limitations, or alternative perspectives can shed light on the argument, method, results, or conclusions?**

Hibbings statements fail to take into account the fact that those with low political interest will follow the natural human trait of conflict avoidance and so this leads to disproportionate support for the first statement 

**Reflections:**

Mutz, 2006 argues that high-intensity deliberation may actually reduce willingness to participate in politics because of the desire to avoid conflict -pg.749

Study by Sanders et al. 2007 showed that there was little difference between the results of the above internet quota method and those of probability samples based on in-person interviews

**Useful readings:**

(Hibbing & Theiss-Morse 2002)



**New notes (7/6/23):**

The sample has a suprising low conflict avoidance, contrary to the hypotheses of Hibbing & Theiss-Morse, only 13.3% chose the conflict-avoidance options, whilst 54% chose the contrary options. 

Though the results are slightly higher when it comes to political argument making them uncomfortable, and not wanting to justify their opinions, up to about 1/5. 

Significantly more respondents can be placed into the high dissatisfied democrat camp than in the high stealth democratic camp. But 25.3% score highly on both measures. 

Then regress willingness to get involved in four different models of politics – deliberative democracy, participatory democracy by referendum, party electoral, and non-party participation. 

Party electoral and non-party are captured as an additive measure. Deliberative is captured through willingness to get involved in a one day event dicusssing important matters with elected representative. Referendum is captured through ‘referendums are a good way to decide important political questions’ (mean = 3.67 on 1-4 scale.

Stealth democrats are less willing to engage in party and non-party, and in deliberative meetings. But do express greater support for referendum use. 

Dissatisfied democrats are more likely to be willing to engage in deliberation, rate referendums highly, or participate in other forms of political activity.
