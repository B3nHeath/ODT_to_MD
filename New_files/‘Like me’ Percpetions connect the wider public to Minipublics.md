**Synopsis:**

An online survey conducted with 1018 participants, selected by Quota, in Northern Ireland. Focuses on opinions regarding a minipublic held on the constitutional future of Northern Ireland. Asked generally their opinion on Citizens Assembly in an advisory capacity and got 6.7 average on 0-10 scale. Mean for willingness to accept decision of Citizens Assembly was lower at 5.8. 

The strongest predictor on support for the use of the Citizens Assembly and its decision was the view that deliberators were like them. Outcome favourability was found to have a rather weak effect. When controlling for it this did not significantly affect the importance of deliberators being like them, and was not a significant predictor of outcome acceptance.

Satisfaction with democracy, political interest, and majority perceptions were insignificant predictors for most part. Majority perceptions had effect on minipublics generally, with comparatively weak 95% CI (0.19 with SE=0.09). No other significant effect with CI of 95% or above. The more educated were more distrusting of their fellow citizens. 

Survey participants rated deliberators as much more similar to themselves than politicians. 

This work did a better job at highlighting the extended discussion involved within deliberation. Didn’t mention the expert provision of information, but think that inclusion of at least 1 makes this a more minor issue. 

Study also looked at what inclusion mechanisms were important for representativeness. Found that inclusion of minority or prejudiced groups was important to everyone, as was inclusion of ‘opposition’ religion. Both working and middle class deemed it important to include the working class within decisions. Low importance was placed on including politicians within the discussion. 

**1) What is the central argument that the authors want to make?**

How close the wider public feel participants resemble them determine how they feel about the use of mini publics

**2) What is the method that the authors use to make that argument?**

Conducts online survey via quota of 1,018 participants to ask about their sentiments towards a minipublic held on the constitutional future of Northern Ireland

**3) What results do the authors obtain from their method?**

For general sentiments towards citizen’s assemblies (asked about advisory where politicians would have final say) (does better job at highlighting the extended discussion but still fails to include the expert information provision), mean result was 6.7 on 11-point scale (starting at 0, end at 10), with a standard deviation of 2.9.

Asked whether ‘I trust ordinary citizens to make political decisions that are in the public interest’. Scale of 1-5, mean of 3.6 and SD=1.1

Asked ‘How willing are you to accept the outcome of the Citizen’s assembly?’, from 0-10. Mean was 5.8 and SD=3.0

Before being told outcome of CA, asked to respond on scale 0-10 sentiments on three statements relating to how similar participants were to themselves. Result was mean of 6.1 and SD =2.3. When asked same about politicians, mean was 2.5 and SD=2.3

Controlled for satisfaction with democracy in NI, level of political interest, also controlled for the perception that their view was the majority perspective (evidence from Werner, 2020 suggests that feeling you hold the majority view boosts support for referendums). Also controlled for outcome favourability in analysis of outcome acceptance

Asked how important different demographic factors are to be included in making decisions on the constitutional future of Northern Ireland: sex, social class, age, ethno-national identity.



Three measures of perceived legitimacy of mini public included; attitude toward citizens’ assemblies, trust in citizens as decision-makers, and outcome acceptance

The more the general public view citizens as like them, the more likely the are to perceive minipublics generally as legitimate. One point increase in being like them leads to 0.65 increase in minipublic legitimacy on same 11-point scale, when controlling for other possible explanations. See similar effect on outcome acceptance with effect of around 0.55. 

Lower perceived similarity between politicians and people leads to higher support for Citizens assemblies, weaker but still significant.

Weaker but significant correlation is also present between like me perceptions against both groups and trust in citizens as decision-makers. Finally, for outcome acceptance only like me perceptions of fellow citizens was significant, with a correlation of 0.57 and SE of 0.04. This only drops to 0.55 when controlling for outcome favourability, with SE slightly increasing to 0.05.

Like me perceptions of fellow citizens is a highly significant predictor. For attitudes towards citizens assemblies in general like me perceptions produce an R squared value of 0.27. For outcome acceptance the like me perception produced an R squared value of 0.19. Effect of other measured variables unimportant. No difference in R for outcome acceptance when including others, and other variables lead to increase of just 0.5 for R for minipublics generally

Satisfaction with democracy, political interest, and majority perceptions were insignificant predictors for most part. Majority perceptions had effect on minipublics generally, with comparatively weak 95% CI (0.19 with SE=0.09). No other significant effect with CI of 95% or above

Protestants were significantly more likely to be disapproving of the citizens assembly generally (0.75 with SE=0.18). As were those of no religion, though not with as strong a CI (only 95%)

Outcome favourability not significant predictor of outcome acceptance

Higher educated were more distrusting of fellow citizens as decision makers (correlation of 0.3, Se=0.07, CI=99.9%)



Conducts ANOVA test to measure the importance of different representative characteristics in the Citizens assembly amongst the wider public (don’t really know how to read these results so can’t be particularly critical of them):

Inclusion of participants from all listed groups (age, gender, social class, ethno-national ideology) is deemed important by everyone, even those from opposing camps such as unionists think it is important to include protestants in the discussion. Groups do place slightly higher importance on including participants from their own ethno-national groups, this is not true of the demographic factors. Both working and middle class groups prioritise the importance of including working class voices. Working class put less importance on inclusion of middle-class than middle-class do.

Low importance placed on including politicians in minipublic (m=4.3, SD=3.3)

**4) What conclusions do the authors draw from their results?**



**5) What counter-arguments, limitations, or alternative perspectives can shed light on the argument, method, results, or conclusions?**

“the absence of a devolved government for over two years at the time of the study may have created a particularly deep sense of frustration with the political system.” Found at the end of the discussion section
