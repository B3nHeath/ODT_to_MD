**Synopsis:**

Conjoint experiment conducted with 2491 Dutch Citizens, participants were told their community would Implement a budget, and were asked to choose how this should be implemented. Used both a choice-based and rating-based conjoint design. These varied in terms of the type of project, who was allowed to provide ideas, the degree of support to foster ideas, the project, location of project, and cost of project. 

The most significant predictor of evaluations was the outcome favourability of the project. This study has a large amount of statistical power, and draws useful conclusions. The one limit I would state is when the author tries to distinguish the motivations behind outcome favourability, think these conclusions are a bit of a stretch. 

**1) What is the central argument that the authors want to make?**

Tests why outcome favourability is so important to individuals with respect to their evaluations over participatory forums. Find that both self-interest and sociotropy are drivers of the significant influence of outcome favourability

**2) What is the method that the authors use to make that argument?**

Uses three survey experiment conducted on Dutch citizens, with a sample size of 2491

Participants were part of a conjoint experiment. Were told that their community would implement a neighbourhood budget next year, and were asked to choose between 6 different pairs of options for how this should be implemented. Also asked to provide a rating for each of the scenarios on a seven-point scale.

The scenarios varied in terms of what the winning project was, who was allowed to contribute their ideas, what type of projects were allowed to be submitted, support from the municipality, and the way that the choice was made. 

Allowed to submit a project: all residents, residents chosen randomly by municipality, residents chosen by neighbourhood, residents chosen by municipality

Who chooses: all residents, only residents that submitted a project, independent experts, civil servants

Allowed projects: anything that serves to benefit, only ideas within themes selected by the municipality

Municipality support: No extra support, organises meeting for residents to discuss the projects, meeting where civil servants help residents develop their proposals

Winning project: repave sidewalks, repave biketracks, revoate playgrounds, renovate squares, install more lights, install more speedbumps, plant more trees and bushes, install more garbage bins

Location of winning project: on your street, one street away, four streets away

Final costs of project: exactly as planned, 5% more than planned, 25% more, 50% more

1stexperiment used to measure the importance of outcome favourability. Compared to how they evaluated each of the projects when asked in separate instance, asked how much they would like to see these projects in their neighbourhood on 7-point scale. Treated scores above 4 as strong favourability and rest as weak favourability

Ran number of robustness checks on results from 1ststage of experiment. Re-weighted results to rensure representativeness in terms of sex and age. The re-ddid the study with 647 respondents from more rural municipalities to check this also occurred in less inhabited municipalities, checked the results using the full sample. The looked at the qualitative portion that asked people to explain why they rated the proposals as they did, which found that words related to the outcomes were used in 41.3% of the responses. Also re-ran the analysis using three different levels of outcome favourability. -pg.4

2ndstudy asked respondents to rank 6 projects in terms of improving the quality of life in their neighbourhood. The highest ranked option by respondents was always the winning project in both options in the conjoint stage.

In the 3rdstudy the incurred cost by the community is an included factor. Otherwise copies the design of study 1. 

**3) What results do the authors obtain from their method?**

“The rating of PBs that result in unfavourable outcomes is, on average, 0.73 points lower on the sevenpoint rating scale. This makes it the strongest predictor of PB support among the included attributes” -pg.4

In 2ndstage, the further away from their street the PB was being implemented, the lower the rating it tended to receive. Only significant decline is when the project is being implemented 4 streets away. Doesn’t compare the significance of this effect to the other factors of the PB design. The effect on rating is similar to the impact from the majority of the other design features. Though it is weaker than the most extreme impacts of design features e.g. the negative effect of civil servants choosing, or the positive effect from either of the options for wider municipal support. -table of results on pg.6

The 3rdstage study shows that going overbudget has a significant effect on the rating which it receives. Going 50% over the budget leads to -0.419 effect on the rating of the PB. At 25% this falls to -0.187, and at 5% an effect of -0.091 -pg.7

Find no interaction effect between going overbudget and outcome fasvourability, suggesting that respondents would still prefer a more favourable outcome even if it incurs higher community costs. Less statistical power for this and so it is a less robust result. 

** ***Subsequent findings (9/6/23):*

all of the factors included are significant. In general I would suggest that the results indicate that people want the least possible restrictions, and support from the municipality in developing the project concepts.

Of primary importance. In who chooses the wining project Civil servants receives the most negative impact, whilst all residents being able to choose has the most benefit. Independent experts also viewed negatively in comparison, but not as negatively as the civil servants. 

Additionally, citizens preferred it when there was no restriction on who was able to submit a project.

Still, the most important factor was outcome favourability. 

Interestingly, they also asked people to explain in their own words what factors influenced their choices at the end of the project. They used a method and found that respondents used words related to outcomes in 41.3% of cases. 

The reason that they say that it is driven by self-interest: They ran the conjoint again but made the winning project the favoured PB, then introduced a new factor which stated how many streets away from them it was implemented. Found that this factor was still significant, though it is important to note that the point estimate for this factor is less than some of the other factors included, such as Civil Servants deciding on the issues. 



**4) What conclusions do the authors draw from their results?**

Draw the conclusion that individuals are mostly self-interested, whilst they care about the community costs this pails in comparison to their own material gains. Don’t think this is a result that can necessarily be drawn from the presented results, even if it may be true in reality. 

**5) What counter-arguments, limitations, or alternative perspectives can shed light on the argument, method, results, or conclusions?**

Feel there is an overestimation of the effect of outcome favouirability. Asks participants how they feel about neighbourhood budgets decided on by other areas for their own area. Therefore the method of decision-making is irrelevant, since it is not catered to their own neighbourhoods preferences

May be an error in the measures used to material and sociotropic importance. Higher costs may be associated with potential taxation increases, or with negative assoiciations arising from inefficiency and higher costs. Can’t be sure that the self-interest measure of how far away it is was interpreted as personal gain, could be viewed as more directly applicable to their street for instance. 

**Reflections:**

“The more a DI leads to outcomes citizens (do not) favour, the more (less) likely they are to express their support for it. Empirical research on DIs has stressed the importance of such ‘instrumental considerations’ (Werner, 2020) for the support citizens express for DIs (Christensen et al., 2020; Landwehr and Harms, 2020) as well as for their willingness to accept the respective policy outcomes (Arnesen, 2017; Arnesen and Peters, 2018; Esaiasson et al., 2019)” -pg.1
